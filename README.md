# FBI Hate Crime Statistics (2016)

The Hate Crime Statistics Program is one of four subprograms of the The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program and provides annual data “about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/resource-pages/aboutucrmain).

The goal of this study is to use these data to investigate:

* What are the most frequently reported motivations for hate crimes in the U.S.?
* Who or what are the most frequently reported victims of hate crimes in the U.S.?
* How does the number of reported hate crimes in each state correlate with population density?
* How does the fraction of reported race motivated crimes in each state correlate with the fraction of 'white' population?
* How are the reported hate crimes distributed across states?
